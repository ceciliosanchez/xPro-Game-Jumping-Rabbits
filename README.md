## Jumping Rabbits

This project showcases how to create animated rabbit icons in JavaScript that jump across the screen, simulating gravity with a playful appearance against a countryside backdrop.

## Functionality

Rabbit icons start at random positions on the floor and jump around the screen from left to right.
Each rabbit has a moderate and varied jump height.
The rabbits change direction and flip horizontally when they reach the screen edges.
A countryside backdrop enhances the visual experience.
